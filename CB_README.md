# Project Title: "AI.Sente - Empowering Money Transfers to Third World Countries"

Final Project for the Building AI course.

## Summary

Sente is a Luganda word for money. AI.Sente is a revolutionary platform designed to simplify and optimize money transfers to third world countries like Uganda. By consolidating multiple service providers into one unified platform and harnessing AI, AI.Sente ensures swift, secure, and cost-effective transfers at favorable exchange rates. Users access the platform through a user-friendly web or mobile application, selecting their desired sending destination, currency, and amount. AI.Sente then presents a curated list of service providers, allowing users to choose the best option. Real-time updates and notifications throughout the process guarantee transparency and peace of mind for senders.

## Background

Sending money to third world countries often involves navigating high costs, fluctuating exchange rates, and the reliability of service providers. AI.Sente addresses these challenges by offering a centralized platform where users can choose from a variety of known reliable service providers, all monitored and managed by AI. This solution is particularly beneficial for individuals from countries like Uganda, providing them with a streamlined and efficient means to support their families. By consolidating these trusted service providers and leveraging AI, AI.Sente ensures users have access to the best possible options for their money transfer needs, while also providing transparency and peace of mind throughout the process.

## How is it Used?

Users access AI.Sente through a user-friendly web or mobile application. They begin by selecting their desired sending destination (the country they want to send money to) and specifying the currency and amount they wish to send. AI.Sente then presents a curated selection of service providers, complete with rates and estimated transaction times. After comparing options, users choose the provider that best suits their needs. The sender inputs additional transfer details and recipient information before finalizing the transfer. Real-time updates and notifications throughout the process ensure transparency and provide peace of mind for senders.

## Data Sources and AI Methods

AI.Sente aggregates data from various money transfer service providers and reliable sources for exchange rate information. Real-time data is collected from the following service providers' webpages:

* [WorldRemit](https://www.worldremit.com/en-se),
* [Remitly](https://www.remitly.com/se/en),
* [SendWave](https://www.sendwave.com/en-gb),
* [WesternUnion](https://www.westernunion.com/se/en/home.html),
* [MoneyGram](https://www.moneygram.com/mgo/se/en/),
* [Xoom](https://www.xoom.com/),
* [Xe.com](https://www.xe.com/).

Machine learning algorithms (linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks) analyze historical transaction data, user preferences, and market trends to optimize the sending process and deliver personalized recommendations. Continuous monitoring of exchange rates and sender behavior enables AI.Sente to provide timely notifications for optimal transaction timing.

## Challenges

Ensuring the reliability and security of the platform, especially in regions with limited infrastructure, poses a significant challenge. Robust authentication mechanisms, protection of vast user data, and defense against cyber attacks are essential considerations. Additionally, integrating with multiple service providers and maintaining up-to-date exchange rate data require strong technology infrastructure and partnerships. Furthermore, AI.Sente must address regulatory hurdles and ensure compliance with local laws and regulations in target countries.

## What's Next?
Future enhancements for AI.Sente may include expanding its coverage to additional third world countries, enhancing user experience with more intuitive interfaces and language support, and integrating additional financial services such as bill payments and mobile top-ups. AI.Sente will continue to evolve to meet the evolving needs of its users and the dynamic landscape of international money transfers.
